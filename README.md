# Qiskit-Global-Summer-School-2023 : Theory-To-Implementation
This repository will contain all the lecture and study materials of IBM QGSSC'23 as well as my solutions for the 5 labs.

![The LSTM unit has four input weights (from the data to the input and three gates) and four recurrent weights (from the output to the input and the three gates). Peepholes are extra connections between the memory cell and the gates, but they do not increase the performance by much and are often omitted for simplicity.
